## web3-signin-app
This project uses "Sign-In with Ethereum", a module using an authentication standard (EIP-4361) that enables secure communication between a frontend and backend. SIWE is a powerful method for creating user sessions based on a wallet connection, and much more.

## Technical Overview

Implementing SIWE only takes four steps:
Connect wallet
Sign SIWE message with nonce generated by backend
Verify submitted SIWE message and signature via POST request
Add validated SIWE fields to session (via JWT, cookie, etc.)
